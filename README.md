# Terraform_script_for_mysql_webserver
Introduction:   
Deploy the infrastructure with the Nodejs application along with the MySQL database using terraform scripts. An environment has pre-defined security that needs to be set at the time of provisioning. This includes setting up routing, security list updates, and the creation of internet gateways and other services. 

Business Scenarios / Requirements / Challenges:  
The customer onboarding new end customers often and every time they need to create compartments, set security, and create the environment manually.

Customer Pain Point:  
The customer wanted to automate the infrastructure provisioning for different customers without much configuration needed so that they can readily use the environment for further application development and replicate the infrastructure for each of its customers without much effort needed in the configuration process, this terraforms script helps the customer with the replication with easily deployable terraform scripts.
